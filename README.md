# Lung-Cancer-Detection-System

Lung cancer is the second most common cancer in the world, with a whopping 2.2 million patients around the globe. Its survival rate is sadly just 20%. This abysmal survival rate can be improved only if this dreadful disease is detected early, and all our project does is make this detection process seamless by decreasing the cost, human effort and patient's wait time. In some countries there are also lack of proper experts who can detect lung cancer through CT scans, our project also solves this problem. Our project can also be extended to detect multiple types of cancers.
